# Learning Arduino

This is a log of my experience as I learn arduino. I am very comfortable programming (I've been a software engineer professionally for 4 years now - and about 1 year of rust programming for hobby projects), but I am less comfortable with electronics. I took a single introduction to electrical engineering class about 5 years ago, but we mostly covered circuit diagrams with a very small lab component.

## Goals:

I have a few goals with this project. Namely:
1. Learn more about embedded programming and how to program machines with literal kilobytes of memory.
1. Learn how to send signals over a Universal Serial Bus (USB).
1. Learn more about electronics and how to wire things up.
1. Create programs that do not require and operating system to run (using Rust).
1. Eventually, I'd like to follow [this tutorial on DIY'ing a guitar hero controller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m44mh3CBKeI) and build the controller with my own firmware installed on it.
